# EXOGOV Protocol

This is the technical layer of EXOVERSE governance — a regenerative, voluntary, and modular coordination architecture.  
The EXOGOV protocol supports decisions beyond coercion, scarcity, and accumulation logic.

---

## 🔧 Components

- `contracts/` — Solidity smart contracts for regenerative voting, reputation-based participation, and treasury flows
- `governance/` — DAO tooling, delegate strategies, proposal templates
- `modules/` — Optional logic layers: consent loops, round-based cycles, modular triggers
- `specs/` — Protocol design docs, architecture specs, governance rules
- `diagrams/` — Visuals describing system architecture and logic

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Solidity (via Foundry or Hardhat)
- Snapshot integration (custom strategies)
- JavaScript/TypeScript for client modules
- IPFS / Ceramic / Farcaster (planned modules)
